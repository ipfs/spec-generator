# InterPlanetary Standards Edited and Integrated to Travel Yonder (IPSEITY)

This is an experiement in improving our standards infrastructure. It publishes to
Fleek and you can enjoy it online at [https://specs.ipfs.tech/](https://specs.ipfs.tech/).

I make no claim that this is perfect or the right way to do this. It can be used
as a foundation, but it can also be taken in another direction.

## Usage

If you want to make a spec, clone this, read the [spec for specs](https://specs.ipfs.tech/meta/spec-for-specs/)
(or just copy `specs/meta/spec-for-specs.md`, it's just enriched MD), and make a new
spec in the right directory under `specs`.

To run the generator you need to have `npm install`ed things, and then you can run
`npm watch`. It will give you the site on `http://localhost:8023` (port may differ
if taken) and auto-refresh when you edit.
